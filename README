# Start the Nodes with "start.sh"
# The first arg is the nodecount, edgecount and the number when a rumor should be believed.
# The fourth argument must be "y" if the execution of nodes should start right after generating the graph

# The lines:
#dot -Tpng $GRAPHFILE > $GRAPHPNG
#feh -. $GRAPHPNG &
# should be commented if you try it with more than 1000 nodes

# All ID, ip and port informations are in the file doc/address_all.txt
# If you want more than 5000 nodes, you have to expand the list

# To controll the nodes, use the bin/controller programm
# First argument should be the port to which a signal should be send
# Afterwards you are asked if the watcher should be started
# Do NOT use the port 25000 as it is used for the watcher
# The watcher gathers all messages from the nodes which believed a rumor
# and writes them into doc/results

# To automate this process you can use the testrun.sh
# First argument is the number of testruns, 2nd is nodecount, 3rd is edgecount and 4th the believing border
# The 5th argument is the sleeptime between the execution of nodes, starting the watcher and gathering 
# the rumor answers before shutting everything down again


# If you want to run more than ~2000 nodes, you need to have more than 128 connections possible at the same time
# To get more than 128 connections you have to modify your system.
# Typically the backlog parameter on the listen(2) systemcall is set
# by your system. Standard Linux uses a max of 128
sysctl -a | grep somaxconn
# If the nodes are started and spreading the rumor, they are bursting
# the watcher with messages depending on the nodecount.
# To increase the number of backlog connections
sysctl -w net.core.somaconn=N
# where N is your wished backlog queue.
